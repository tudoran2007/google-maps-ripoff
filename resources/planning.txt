i think that we should (at least for now) not use the road objects and just have the cities; we can add the roads and time calculation later
Each map stores the location of all city nodes. The user then uses a function, telling it to calculate the path from city1 to city2. this
function goes to city1, as it is stored by the map, then finds a path between city1 and city2 using recursion.
